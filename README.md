# KUALA: Kinase drUgs mAchine Learning frAmework

Multi-target priority scores are contained in the results folder.
Each row contains:
* Kinase Uniprot ID
* ChEMBL ID of the ligand predicted as active
* MTPS score for kinase-ligand pair
* Status of the repurposing choice

## Machine learning models 
Trained models to predict activity for our set of kinases can be downloaded from Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6554043

## Results
A comprehensive overview of repurposable drugs for each kinase is reported on figure below:
